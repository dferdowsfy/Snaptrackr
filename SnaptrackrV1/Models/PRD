Snaptrackr PRD – Expanded Features for Inventory, AI Repurchase & Geolocation
Overview: This PRD of  Snaptrackr’s product requirements to include robust User Inventory Tracking, Intelligent Repurchase Notifications, and Geolocation-Based Alerts. These features leverage AI and real-time data to help users manage household items, predict reordering needs, and get timely reminders based on location. Technical considerations for barcode scanning, receipt parsing, AI consumption modeling, and push notifications are included to guide implementation.
1. User Inventory Tracking
Barcode scanning via smartphone enables quick, accurate inventory entry and price comparisons across retailers .
Feature Description: Snaptrackr will allow users to maintain a personal inventory of grocery and household items. Users can add items in three ways: by scanning barcodes with their phone’s camera, by manual text entry, or by uploading/forwarding purchase receipts. Upon adding an item, the app logs its name, quantity, and other details in the user’s inventory list.
	•	Barcode Scanning Input: Using the smartphone camera, users can scan an item’s UPC barcode to add it. The app decodes the barcode and automatically fetches the product name and details so the user doesn’t have to type them in . This improves accuracy and efficiency of inventory tracking, since barcode scans eliminate manual data entry errors . Technically, this requires integrating a mobile vision library or API (e.g. built-in iOS/Android barcode scanning frameworks or ZXing) to detect and decode barcodes in real time.
	•	Real-Time Product Data via LLM: Instead of relying on a static internal product database, Snaptrackr will use an AI-powered web search to retrieve current product info (name, category) and pricing when a barcode is scanned. For example, after decoding a UPC the app can query an LLM-backed service to find the item’s description and prices at various stores online. This approach ensures up-to-date pricing and availability data, as the AI can pull the “freshest data available” from the web . It avoids the need to maintain a massive internal UPC database (some apps use databases of millions of items ), while still providing the user instant information on the scanned product. The system should be designed to call an external API or search service (with the barcode as input) and parse the results for price and store info.
	•	Price Comparison Across Stores: When an item is scanned, Snaptrackr will display price offers from multiple retailers so users can compare and decide where to buy. For example, scanning a box of cereal could show that it’s $3.99 at Store A, $3.79 at Store B, etc., in real time. This feature leverages the LLM web search integration to fetch pricing from grocery store websites or price databases on-the-fly. As noted, consumers already use barcode apps to instantly get competitor pricing and product reviews – Snaptrackr will embed this capability to help users find the best deals. Technical consideration: Implement a caching and rate-limiting strategy for these web searches to keep the app responsive, and use NLP to extract the price numbers from search results. (The AI should interpret the web data and return a structured list of store-price pairs.)
	•	Manual Entry & Editing: Users can also manually add items by entering the name and quantity (for uncommon items without barcodes, like farmers’ market goods). They should be able to edit item details in their inventory (e.g. adjust quantity after consumption or correct any info). These manual pathways ensure all items can be tracked, even if no barcode or receipt is available.
	•	Inventory Dashboard: The app’s dashboard will list all tracked items with their quantities, purchase dates, and possibly expiry dates (if applicable). This gives users a clear view of what they have on hand and how much. Barcode input ties into this by quickly updating stock counts – scanning can increment an item’s quantity or add a new entry if not already in the inventory. By using barcodes, users get fast, reliable inventory updates, allowing them to “stay on top of how much stock you have” with minimal effort .
Technical Considerations – Barcode Scanning: Ensure the scanning component provides fast recognition and works offline if needed (for basic barcode-to-number decoding). The app should handle UPC/EAN codes and possibly QR codes. Leverage device hardware acceleration for camera focusing and decoding for a smooth user experience. If using an LLM or web API for product lookup, design fallbacks (e.g., if no internet, use a smaller local database for common items or queue the lookup for later). Because scanning is critical, implement tests with various lighting and barcode conditions. Also, consider using the phone’s flash for scanning in low light, and guided UI (framing box) to help users aim the camera.
2. Receipt Data Extraction
Snaptrackr will parse receipts (like the above Walmart receipt) with OCR, extracting each line item (name, quantity, price) for the user’s purchase history .
Feature Description: Users can add purchases to Snaptrackr by scanning paper receipts with the app’s camera or by forwarding e-receipts via email. The system will automatically extract structured data from these receipts and update the user’s inventory and purchase history. Key data to capture include item names, quantities, prices, store name, and purchase date.
	•	In-App Receipt Scanning: The app will have a built-in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) feature. A user can take a photo of their physical grocery receipt; the app will then process the image to read the text. The OCR engine (or an AI service) is configured in a special “receipt mode” to recognize the typical line-by-line format of receipts . Each line (or table row) usually contains an item name and price, sometimes a quantity or unit. The system will parse these lines to identify the item names, quantities, and prices of everything the user bought . It will also extract the merchant/store name and date from the header or footer of the receipt. This requires a combination of OCR and NLP: OCR converts the image to raw text, and then NLP algorithms interpret the text (e.g. knowing “TOTAL” indicates the end of item list, or that a date like 07/28/17 is the purchase date on the receipt ). Modern receipt-scanning tech employs machine learning to improve accuracy on varied receipt layouts – Snaptrackr will do the same, ensuring even handwritten totals or obscure abbreviations are correctly understood.
	•	Email Receipt Import: Users can optionally forward their email receipts (for online grocery orders or in-store digital receipts) to a special Snaptrackr email address. The system will ingest these emails, detect attached receipts or receipt text, and process them through the same extraction pipeline. For example, a user forwards a receipt email from store@example.com; Snaptrackr’s backend will parse the email for item details and add those to the user’s account. Auto-forwarding of e-receipts is supported by some apps (e.g. SparkReceipt auto-reads forwarded receipts and categorizes them with AI ), and Snaptrackr will similarly “take care of the rest” by reading and extracting data without user intervention. This feature will require an email processing service and a way to map the sending email to the correct Snaptrackr user account (likely by having users register their email with us or use a unique forwarding address).
	•	Populating Purchase History & Inventory: Once a receipt is processed, all the extracted items and quantities are added to the user’s purchase history (a log of what was bought, where, and when). The user’s inventory counts are also updated: for each item on the receipt, if it already exists in the inventory list, the quantity is incremented by the purchased amount; if it’s a new item, it’s added to the inventory with that quantity. The purchase date is recorded for each item (this will feed into the repurchase prediction system). For example, scanning a receipt with “Milk – 2 @ $3.00” from Walmart on Nov 1, 2025 will update the “Milk” item in inventory (add 2 units, note last purchase on 11/01/2025, store Walmart). The user can view the receipt details in the app if needed (for verification or returns), but they don’t need to manually log any of this data.
	•	Data Extraction Accuracy: Snaptrackr will utilize AI to intelligently read even messy receipts. This includes handling different formats (supermarket receipts vs. wholesale club receipts, etc.), ignoring irrelevant text (coupons, legal info), and focusing on essential fields: merchant, date, each line item’s name and price, item quantity or weight, and the total. Advanced techniques like table structure recognition will be employed to keep line items and their prices linked correctly . For instance, if a receipt lists items in two columns (item and price), the software will maintain that relationship when turning it into data, so that the correct price is attached to the correct item. AI models (possibly an LLM) can assist by interpreting context – e.g., understanding that “TAX 1 6.750% 4.59” is a tax line, not an item . We will also integrate some rule-based checks (business logic) to validate the OCR results (for example, ensuring the sum of item prices matches the subtotal on the receipt, flagging any large discrepancies) to improve reliability .
	•	User Dashboard Updates: After extraction, the user’s dashboard or home screen can highlight new items or changes. For example, “Added 5 items from Giant Eagle receipt on Sep 10”. The system can also show spending summaries by store or category using this data. All this happens seamlessly – the user essentially just snaps a photo or forwards an email, and Snaptrackr “automatically extracts all information… and categorizes accordingly” using AI , populating the app with structured data without manual input.
Technical Considerations – Receipt Parsing: Implement or integrate an OCR solution optimized for receipts (such as Tesseract with receipt presets, or a cloud OCR API in receipt mode). Consider using a cloud service like Google Vision or Taggun for higher accuracy, as they specialize in receipts with line-item detail . If using a local ML model, ensure it’s trained on a wide variety of receipt fonts and formats. Use NLP for entity recognition: identify store names (perhaps via a known store list or by looking at the top lines), dates (look for date patterns near the bottom or top), and item lines (which often have a price at the end of the line). Since receipts can be long, performance optimizations like cropping the image to content area and enhancing contrast will help OCR. Also, handle email receipts by parsing HTML/text – these might be easier since they’re already text, but still require extracting the right fields (possibly via regex or an LLM prompt to find the items list). Security: for email import, protect user privacy by limiting who can send in receipts (e.g., only the user’s verified address). Finally, allow users to correct any mis-read data (with an edit interface) – this corrected data can be fed back to improve the ML models over time.
3. AI-Driven Repurchase Prediction
Feature Description: Snaptrackr will include an intelligent system that learns each user’s consumption and repurchase patterns, then provides timely reminders and suggestions. After observing a few purchase cycles for an item, the app’s AI can predict roughly when that item will run low and need buying again. It will then notify the user that a repurchase is likely needed, and even proactively suggest adding it to their shopping list. This feature aims to ensure users never unexpectedly run out of staple products.
	•	Learning Consumption Patterns: Snaptrackr will analyze the intervals between repeated purchases to gauge how quickly the user goes through each product. For example, if a user buys a 5 lb bag of rice every 60 days, or a gallon of milk roughly every 10 days, the system detects that pattern after a few instances. Initially, the user’s intake responses or profile setup can help – during onboarding or when adding an item, we might ask how often they use it (or family size, etc.). These responses can be used to craft prompts for an LLM to refine understanding of consumption habits. However, the primary learning comes from actual receipt data: after 2–3 purchases of the same item, Snaptrackr calculates an average consumption rate or identifies a cycle. This is similar to how large retailers use AI to predict customer reorders – for instance, Walmart uses AI to predict when people are likely to buy certain products again . Snaptrackr brings this capability to the individual level, tailoring it to each user’s habits.
	•	Repurchase Reminders: Once the system has a prediction (e.g., User typically needs milk ~10 days after purchase), it will set a reminder for that item. When the predicted date approaches, Snaptrackr generates a notification like “You’re probably running low on milk. Time to buy again soon.” These AI-generated reminders will appear as push notifications on the user’s phone and/or as alerts within the app. The timing of the reminder might be adjusted by the AI model based on confidence (for instance, after more data, it might refine the interval). The goal is to gently prompt the user before they run out. The user can customize how early they want to be reminded (e.g., 2 days before expected depletion).
	•	Smart Shopping List Suggestions: The app’s shopping list feature will tie into these predictions. If a user is adding something to their list, Snaptrackr will check if other items are due for repurchase as well. For example, when adding “pasta” to the list, the app might pop up: “You usually buy pasta sauce every 30 days, and it’s been 28 days since last purchase. Add tomato sauce to your list?” This is an intelligent nudge based on the predictive model. It’s akin to an AI “predictive basket” that anticipates what the user likely needs . According to industry data, such predictions can be quite accurate (the example Predictive Basket has ~75% accuracy for reorders ). In Snaptrackr, this means when the user opens the app or starts a new shopping list, they might see a section “Don’t forget these items” with a personalized list of products that the AI thinks they’ll need soon. This simplifies list building and ensures commonly used items aren’t forgotten .
	•	AI Model Approach: Snaptrackr will utilize a combination of straightforward statistical modeling and advanced AI (like an LLM or a small neural network) for this feature. Initially, a simple average interval or a moving window could determine the cycle length for each item. As more data accumulates, an LLM could be prompted with the user’s purchase history (e.g., “User bought coffee on Jan 5, Feb 2, Mar 4… what is the usage frequency and next likely buy date?”) to see if it infers any seasonal variations or other insights. However, a more deterministic approach might suffice for regular intervals. The “Intake responses” mentioned (like user indicating high/medium/low usage for an item) can be used to inform the model prior to having data – essentially a prior estimate. The AI then adjusts the predictions after seeing actual behavior. All these computations will happen server-side so that complex models won’t slow the mobile app.
	•	Continuous Improvement: The prediction system gets more accurate over time. It will update its intervals with each new purchase record. If a user starts buying something more often (e.g., their household size increased), the reminders will adapt. The user can also give feedback (“remind me later” or “I still have plenty”) which the AI can incorporate to avoid over-reminding. The design should ensure reminders are helpful, not annoying – perhaps consolidating multiple item alerts into one notification if appropriate.
Technical Considerations – Consumption Modeling: To implement this, we will maintain per-item purchase timestamps in the database. A scheduled job or trigger after each new receipt entry can recalc the average interval for that item for that user. For pattern recognition beyond averages (like alternating purchases or seasonal items), a lightweight machine learning model could be employed. We might use a time-series forecasting library or even treat it as a regression problem (predict next purchase date given past intervals). Using an LLM for this might be overkill, but could be experimented with for complex patterns. We should also consider edge cases: items that have insufficient data (we don’t start predicting until at least 2 data points), items bought in bulk sporadically, etc., and set logic to handle those (maybe mark some items as “one-off” purchases if they don’t repeat).
For the notification aspect, integrate with the mobile OS push notification scheduler. On the app backend, once a next expected date is determined, schedule a push notification for that date. Allow the user to opt in/out for each item’s reminders (some users may not want certain reminders). Ensure the message content is clear and contextual (“Due for repurchase: Eggs – you last bought them 2 weeks ago”). Logging when notifications are sent and if the user acts on them (e.g., adds to list) can further train the system about usefulness.
4. Geolocation-Based Shopping Alerts
Feature Description: Snaptrackr will actively alert users when they are near a store where they have pending needs, effectively leveraging geolocation to remind users to buy items at the right place and time. The app will detect when the user is in or near a grocery store or supermarket and then check the user’s inventory and shopping list for any items that could be purchased there. If matches are found, Snaptrackr will send a real-time notification encouraging the user to take advantage of the opportunity (“You’re near Trader Joe’s – you need eggs and bread, which are sold here. Don’t forget to pick them up!”). This feature uses geofencing technology to create location-based reminders, ensuring users get timely prompts while they are shopping or nearby, rather than remembering later at home.
	•	Geofence Triggers: The application will define geofences (virtual boundaries) around known grocery stores, supermarkets, pharmacies, and other relevant retail locations. When the user’s smartphone location (via GPS) enters one of these geofenced areas, the app will trigger an alert if appropriate. Modern mobile platforms allow efficient geofencing such that entering or exiting a defined area can launch an app action. For Snaptrackr, upon entering a store’s vicinity, it will cross-check if the user’s shopping list or low-inventory items correspond to that store. For example, if the user has “Milk” on their list and they walk near a Walmart, the app knows Walmart sells milk and can send the reminder. Geolocation push notifications are a well-established concept – they’re commonly used to inform users about nearby deals or tasks when they enter a location . Here we tailor them to the user’s own grocery needs, creating a highly personalized shopping assistant.
	•	Store Database and Mapping: Snaptrackr will maintain or access a database of store locations (or use an API like Google Places) to know when a user is near a relevant store. We may allow the user to designate “favorite” stores or automatically detect frequent stores to prioritize those. The geolocation alert will include the store name for context. For accuracy, the geofence radius might be about 100-200 meters around store coordinates to catch the user as they approach or enter. We will ask for the necessary location permissions from the user to enable this feature (and explain the benefit clearly to encourage opt-in).
	•	Notification Content and Timing: When triggered, the notification will list the items needed and possibly highlight any deals. For instance: “At Costco? You’re low on olive oil and paper towels – both available here. Also, there’s a discount on olive oil this week.” The alert should appear shortly after entering the store (or in the parking lot) so the user sees it before or as they start shopping. We will make these notifications actionable – e.g., tapping the notification can open Snaptrackr directly to the shopping list or to a store-specific list of needed items. If no needed items coincide with that store, then no notification is sent (to avoid spamming the user with irrelevant location pings).
	•	Price-Aware Alerts: A key enhancement is integrating the price comparison engine with location alerts. When the user is near a store, Snaptrackr can quickly fetch any known deals or price drops for items the user needs. This way, the notification not only reminds them of what to buy, but assures them it’s a good time to buy it (or even suggests which store to choose). For example, if the user is near Store A but that item is significantly cheaper at Store B down the road, the app could inform them: “You’re near Store A, but your needed item is $5 cheaper at Store B (0.5 miles away).” However, to keep it simple and user-friendly, the first version might just stick to reminding at whatever store the user is currently near, possibly noting if the store has a known sale. We will need to continuously update store pricing info (perhaps via the same LLM web search, pulling weekly ad data or using price APIs) to have this knowledge. Location-based coupon alerts are a common marketing tactic ; Snaptrackr repurposes this idea to benefit the user’s budget automatically.
	•	User Control and Privacy: In settings, users can enable/disable geolocation alerts globally or for certain store chains. We recognize not everyone wants their location tracked at all times, so we’ll be transparent about how the feature works and allow opting out. If enabled, the app will run minimal background location checks to conserve battery (both iOS and Android have efficient geofence APIs to help with this). All location data stays on-device except when a geofence event triggers needed-item lookup (which could be done on-device as well since the list is local). We won’t store or misuse precise location history beyond this feature’s scope.
Technical Considerations – Real-Time Notifications: Implement geofencing using platform-specific APIs (e.g., Android Location Services Geofencing API and iOS Region Monitoring). We’ll seed the geofence manager with a list of coordinates for grocery stores (perhaps major chains initially). Because monitoring thousands of geofences can be heavy, we might use a strategy: monitor a user’s general region, then dynamically add geofences for stores in their vicinity. Alternatively, use an external SDK like Radar or Google Awareness API which can handle large POI-based geofencing with categories (Radar, for example, can detect “visits to millions of places” with chain detection ). Once a geofence breach is detected, the app wakes and checks the local database for needed items. The push notification is then constructed. This all needs to happen quickly – within seconds of entering – for maximum relevance.
For the pricing aspect, if we have cached local price info or an offline database of typical prices, use that to avoid slow network calls at trigger time. If a network call is needed (to an LLM or API for store prices), consider using the phone’s connectivity (which should be available in-store via cellular or Wi-Fi). The notification should not be delayed too long waiting for price info; if it’s not readily available, better to show the reminder without it. Finally, test the reliability thoroughly: the system should not miss triggers nor trigger too frequently (debounce entering/exiting same location in short time, etc.).
Conclusion: These new features – Inventory Tracking with barcode scans, Automated Receipt Data Extraction, AI-driven Repurchase Predictions, and Geolocation-Based Alerts – together make Snaptrackr a smarter personal shopping assistant. They ensure the user’s inventory is always up-to-date with minimal effort, anticipate needs using AI (just as cutting-edge retailers do , but for individual benefit), and deliver timely reminders both time-based and location-based. Implementing these will involve integrating several technologies (mobile OCR, large language models for data lookup and pattern analysis, and location services), but each component is grounded in proven use cases: barcode scanning improves inventory accuracy , receipt OCR is already used for expense tracking , AI predictions of customer needs streamline shopping , and geofencing triggers context-aware notifications . By combining them, Snaptrackr will significantly enhance grocery shopping efficiency and prevent the annoyance of forgotten items or surprise stockouts for its users.
